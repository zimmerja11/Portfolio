    <h2>Internship at Auto-Owners Insurance <img src='pics/auto_owners.png' alt='Auto-Owners Logo' height='35'/></h2>

    <p>At Auto-Owners, I had the opportunity to gain experience with a large variety of different types of projects: I spent a significant amount of time creating Generalized Linear Models for use in setting customer prices; I worked on several exploratory data analysis projects that culminated in my creating and presenting reports on the findings; I performed a data pull for specific data from the company's extensive network of databases; and I got to explore the viability of using machine-learning algorithms to streamline workflow both internally and for customers.</p>

    <p>At the outset of my internship, I set three learning goals that I hoped to achieve by the end of the summer.  My first learning goal was to gain a better understanding of the concepts and applications of Generalized Linear Models, and I feel that I have surpassed that. I learned a lot about important basic concepts for building GLM's, how to guide decision-making while in the process of building, different techniques for improving the performance of such models, and gained insight into how these models are used in the business world.</p>

    <p>Another goal that I believe I surpassed - thanks to my time spent on many different projects - was my desire to improve my understanding of the workflows, data structure/flows, and decision-making processes within a large company: I got to see how vital data is stored, accessed, and manipulated; how data goes from raw to cleaned to analysis; and I fortunate enough to take part in the high-level decision-making processes within Actuarial.</p>

    <p>As nearly every project that I worked on required me to create a report at the end, I feel that I easily reached my third goal, improving my ability to effectively and concisely report results. However, I soon found that I needed to know more about where the report was going to write a truly effective report - Who is reading it? What decisions will they be making based on it? How would those decisions be implemented? etc. This taught me to ask more questions about the company's internal decision-making processes, and had the added bonus of providing more insight into the greater structure of the company.  I feel that this skill, learned from my experiences performing analysis and creating reports, was possibly the most important skill I developed at my internship. Knowing how to tailor a report to its audience and its applications is vital for the type of information analysis work I hope to find a career in; If I lack the ability to convey the messages implied by my data analysis, then it won't matter if my analysis reveals interesting conclusions or not.   Overall, I feel that this internship has had a positive impact on my future career. Based on my experiences in the Actuarial Analytics team and speaking with other professionals, I've found that I'm most interested in working on machine learning applications. In the future, I plan to seek roles that will provide me with opportunities to further this goal.<p>

    <h2> Sustainable Systems Project Leader in Ross Net Impact <img src='pics/net_impact_logo.png' alt='Auto-Owners Logo' height='35'/></h2>

    <p>As a project manager for Net Impact, a student organization working to promote positive environmental and social change in the Ann Arbor community, I have accrued valuable experience working as a team leader and representative.  Our project was to implement a volunteer composting and green values program in all on-campus food retailers (i.e. University-owned cafes, convenience stores, etc.).  As project manager and team representative, I learned how to take an idea from concept to reality as part of a team, including how to manage the schedules, ideas, and personalities of the various team members to keep our team members engaged and motivated and to ensure our project continued moving forward within our timeline. Furthermore, my efforts in developing action plans collaboratively with the University Dining Department and several other sustainability-focused student-organizations taught me to effectively present ideas to and coordinate with the third-party stakeholders.  To date, we have seen a 30% increase in post-consumer composting in locations targeted by our project, and our informational program materials are now standard in all on-campus food retailers.<p>
